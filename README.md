This is a Python coding work on Google Collab which makes the job of a Process Engineer/Process Analyst that much easier. It automates the whole data part of the Process, and the real data obviously needs to be taken, but if it can be compared to these automated values of different input fresh_marigold_kg, then we can understand whether the required conversion/quality is reached. This is especially useful in the case of conversion of Raw Material.


AVT_Marigold_Analysis_VS

This is a Project Work which depicts how SQL was used in the case where Excel was failing. AVT Natural, which is a leading Sovent Extract Manufacturing firm in Kochi, Kerala has many branches across South India. AVT Natural is a major produder and exporter of Marigold Luteinester, which is extracted with the help of multiple solvents, and multiple Unit Operations in an Industry setting. Its Manufacturing happens continuously throughout the year, and therefore, many lot numbers and their respective batch numbers are supplied to the different departments, at different times. Firstly, the Marigold flower undergoes Pre-treatment in the Pre-Treatment Plant (PRT). Next, it goes to the Solvent Extraction Plant (SEP) for both Extraction of the Luteinester, and the Second Part (Or Department) in the SEP deals with concentrating the Luteinester by Stripping out the Solvent from the mixture. Finally, the Marigold Luteinester Batch goes to the Drying department. Due to the continuous nature of the process, there are many lot numbers produced, with a lot of different information. 
SQL usage was brought upon because the data of so many years was piling up and Excel would often fail. The AVT_Marigold_Analysis_VS just shows a small snippet of my work with Data in AVT Natural.

Luteinester 2024.xlsx is the MS Excel Documentation of the same. The viewer can download both files, and go through a small portion of my work at AVT Natural.

Apart from all the Data Visualization and Analytics work, I was also working on the Material (Mass and Energy) Balance of the entire process.
I have documented that in the last part of this Repository. As you can see, it is here in the Marigold LUTEINESTER MB-1.xlsx.
